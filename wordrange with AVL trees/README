Code files: Makefile, main.cpp, avl.cpp, avl.h
Test files: simple-input.txt, simple-output.txt, allwords-basic.txt, allwords-basic-output.txt, allwords-more-range.txt, allwords-more-range-output.txt
Extra files: README

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program parses through designated input file which contains 2 types of operations, i and r. 
i means insert the following string, r means get the number of values lexographically between following two strings and write it to the output file.

Example input file:
i <string>
r <string1> <string2>   (Note: string1 must be less than string2)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE: 
1) Run "make", to get executable "wordrange".
2) Run "./wordrange <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

CITATION:
Code for insert, balance, rotate_right, and rotate_left is recreated from this link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/
Additional code in the functions was written to reconnect child and parent pointer since the reference didn't implement a parent pointer of each node.

Code for deleteAVL and printInOrder is from provided BST code.
